# Report Overview

This report discusses mental health apprehensions in Toronto using data from Open Data Toronto published by Toronto Police Services. The data shows an increase in apprehensions since 2014 with a steep incline from 2020 to 2021 within the context of COVID-19 and an inflated police budget. The report shows how the misallocation of tax payer funds away from mental health resources and toward police services will only continue to increase apprehensions and escalate conflicts. 

It is organised by folders where 'Inputs' include raw and cleaned data, and 'Outputs' include the final paper and references. 'Scripts' include where data was downloaded and cleaned, as well as simulated data and subsequent tests.
